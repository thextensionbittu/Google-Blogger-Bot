# Google-Blogger-Bot
Here is an example of a simple Python code that uses the Google Blogger API to create a bot that can automatically post a new blog post on your Blogspot blog.
Note that you'll need to have a developer account and create a project on the Google developer console to get the access_token and blog_id and also enable Blogger API.
This is just a simple example and you can add more functionality to your bot like scheduling posts, reading posts, editing posts and so on.
